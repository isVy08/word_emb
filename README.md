# Unpack NLP Black Box
This repo tracks my (desperate) self-teaching journey of [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) techniques and algorithms.
I examine the mathematical bedrock and implement the algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm basically comes with 2 files: implementation code and math notes in folder *mian* (math in a nutshell). I also include papers, blogs and other reference materials in the math notes.        

**Updates**: 
- Continuous Bag of Words (Mikolov et al, 2013)
